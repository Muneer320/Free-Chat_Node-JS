# Free-Chat_Node-JS

Hey guys, this is my first trial with Node JS so if you find any bugs in it then please let me know so that I can improve it.

It's basically a web based chat application with which you can chat with your friends over the web.
You can host it on internet if you want then you would be able to talk to anybody who's using this web-app.
It can be developed the way you want it to be, the only thing needed is imagination...
And one more thing before using it anywhere you first need to make a node server for it and add it in the file.
